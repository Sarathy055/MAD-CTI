# MAD-CTI: Multi-Agent Dark Web Threat Intelligence Platform

## 🚀 Overview

MAD-CTI (Multi-Agent Dark Web Cyber Threat Intelligence) is an AI-powered threat intelligence framework designed to detect, classify, and analyze emerging cyber threats from dark web sources in real time.

Traditional detection systems struggle against evolving attack vectors such as ransomware, phishing kits, zero-day exploits, and credential dumps. MAD-CTI addresses this gap using a scalable multi-agent NLP-based architecture for proactive cyber defense.
